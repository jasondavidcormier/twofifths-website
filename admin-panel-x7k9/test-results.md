### Test Cases

#### 1. API Loading Test
**Purpose**: Verify Google API script loads correctly
**Expected**: Google API (gapi) should be available in window object
**Status**: [PENDING]
**Results**: 
- [ ] Google API script loads
- [ ] `window.gapi` is available
- [ ] No console errors during load

#### 2. API Initialization Test
**Purpose**: Verify Google API client initializes with correct configuration
**Expected**: API client should initialize with our credentials and scopes
**Status**: [PENDING]
**Results**:
- [ ] `gapi.client.init()` succeeds
- [ ] Client ID and API key accepted
- [ ] Discovery document loads
- [ ] Scopes are set correctly

#### 3. Auth Instance Test
**Purpose**: Verify authentication instance is created and accessible
**Expected**: Auth instance should be available and functional
**Status**: [PENDING]
**Results**:
- [ ] `gapi.auth2.getAuthInstance()` returns valid instance
- [ ] Auth state listener can be attached
- [ ] Current sign-in status can be checked

#### 4. Sign-In Flow Test
**Purpose**: Test the complete sign-in process
**Expected**: User should be able to sign in and grant permissions
**Status**: [PENDING]
**Results**:
- [ ] Sign-in popup appears
- [ ] User can authenticate with Google
- [ ] Permissions are granted
- [ ] Access token is received
- [ ] User profile information is accessible

#### 5. Permissions Verification Test
**Purpose**: Verify all required permissions are granted
**Expected**: Drive file access permissions should be available
**Status**: [PENDING]
**Results**:
- [ ] Required scopes are granted
- [ ] Access token includes correct permissions
- [ ] Scope verification passes

#### 6. Drive Access Test
**Purpose**: Test basic Google Drive API functionality
**Expected**: Should be able to list files and access Drive
**Status**: [PENDING]
**Results**:
- [ ] `drive.files.list()` succeeds
- [ ] API returns file list
- [ ] No permission errors
- [ ] Response format is correct

#### 7. File Access Test
**Purpose**: Test access to specific target file
**Expected**: Should be able to access the target content file
**Status**: [PENDING]
**Results**:
- [ ] Target file can be accessed by ID
- [ ] File metadata is retrievable
- [ ] File content can be read (if exists)
- [ ] Appropriate error handling for missing file

#### 8. Sign-Out Flow Test
**Purpose**: Test the sign-out process
**Expected**: User should be able to sign out cleanly
**Status**: [PENDING]
**Results**:
- [ ] Sign-out process completes
- [ ] Auth state updates correctly
- [ ] Access tokens are invalidated
- [ ] User info is cleared

### Error Scenarios Tested

#### Authentication Errors
- [ ] Invalid client ID handling
- [ ] Network connectivity issues
- [ ] User cancels sign-in
- [ ] Insufficient permissions granted

#### API Errors
- [ ] Rate limiting responses
- [ ] Invalid file ID access
- [ ] Network timeouts
- [ ] Malformed requests

#### State Management Errors
- [ ] Multiple sign-in attempts
- [ ] Sign-out while operations pending
- [ ] Browser refresh during auth
- [ ] Tab switching during auth

### Performance Metrics
- **API Load Time**: [To be measured]
- **Initialization Time**: [To be measured]
- **Sign-in Duration**: [To be measured]
- **First API Call Response**: [To be measured]

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)

- [ ] Content upload functionality
- [ ] Content download functionality
- [ ] Auto-sync system integration

### Known Issues
[To be documented during testing]

### Recommendations
[To be filled based on test results]

### Next Steps
Based on test results:
1. **If all tests pass**: Proceed to Step 3.2 (Upload/Download Testing)
2. **If authentication fails**: Debug OAuth configuration
3. **If API access fails**: Check permissions and scopes
4. **If file access fails**: Verify file sharing and permissions
