## Testimonial Structure Template

### Format 1: Problem-Solution-Result
```
"[Brief description of challenge/problem]. [How the service/product helped]. [Specific results achieved]. [Recommendation or overall sentiment]."

Example:
"We struggled with partnerships for two years before Jason joined us. Within 90 days, he had us live with 5 major integrations and a clear roadmap for scaling. The ROI was immediate and substantial. I'd recommend Jason to any SaaS company serious about partnership growth."
```

### Format 2: Transformation Story
```
"[Before state]. [Working with company experience]. [After state/results]. [Personal recommendation]."

Example:
"Our partnership program was scattered and ineffective. Jason completely transformed our approach with his strategic expertise and network. We now have partnerships driving 40% of our new business. His expertise opened doors we didn't even know existed."
```

### Format 3: Specific Outcome Focus
```
"[Specific result/metric]. [Brief context of how it was achieved]. [Why this matters/impact]. [Endorsement]."

Example:
"We achieved 60% revenue growth in 8 months working with Jason. His deep network and strategic thinking helped us identify partnership opportunities we never would have found on our own. The results speak for themselves - I can't recommend him highly enough."
```
